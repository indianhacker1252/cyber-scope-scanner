# VAPT Security Scanner - Production Deployment Guide

**Copyright ¬© 2024 Harsh Malik. All Rights Reserved.**

## üîê Enterprise-Grade Security Testing Platform

This tool is a professional Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) platform that integrates real Kali Linux tools with AI-powered analysis.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NO DEMO MODE

This application **DOES NOT USE FAKE OR DEMO DATA**. All scans are real-time and connect to actual Kali Linux backend tools. If the backend is not available, the application will not function and will display clear error messages.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Real-time WebSocket streaming from backend
- No mock data or demo modes
- Comprehensive error logging
- AI-powered recommendations via Exa.ai

### Backend (Node.js + Kali Linux)
- Direct integration with Kali Linux security tools
- WebSocket streaming for real-time output
- Session management and timeout handling
- Tool execution with proper privilege handling

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
1. **Kali Linux Environment** (Required)
   - Latest Kali Linux 2024.x
   - Root/sudo access for tool execution
   - All required tools installed (see tool list below)

2. **Node.js Backend**
   - Node.js v18+ 
   - npm or yarn
   - Port 8080 available

3. **Frontend Hosting**
   - Any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
   - Or serve via Node.js

### Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Install Kali Linux tools (if not already installed)
chmod +x install-kali-tools.sh
sudo ./install-kali-tools.sh

# 2. Start the backend server
cd server
npm install
sudo node index.js  # Requires sudo for privileged scans
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build for production
npm run build

# 3. Serve the build
npm run preview
# OR deploy the 'dist' folder to your hosting provider
```

### Environment Configuration

Update `src/config/apiConfig.ts` if deploying backend to a different server:

```typescript
export const API_CONFIG = {
  BASE_URL: 'http://YOUR_SERVER:8080',  // Change this
  WS_URL: 'ws://YOUR_SERVER:8080',      // Change this
  // ... rest of config
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Integrated Kali Linux Tools

This platform integrates **30+ real Kali Linux tools**:

### Reconnaissance
- Nmap (Network mapper)
- DNS enumeration (dig)
- WHOIS lookup
- SSL certificate analysis (openssl)
- Amass (subdomain enumeration)
- theHarvester (OSINT)
- Sublist3r
- Recon-ng

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Nikto (Web vulnerability scanner)
- Nuclei (Template-based scanner)
- WhatWeb (Web fingerprinting)
- SSLyze (SSL/TLS scanner)
- Wapiti (Web application scanner)

### Web Application Testing
- SQLMap (SQL injection)
- XSStrike (XSS detection)
- Gobuster (Directory enumeration)
- Dirb
- WPScan (WordPress security)
- Commix (Command injection)
- Wafw00f (WAF detection)

### Network Scanning
- Masscan (Fast port scanner)
- Enum4linux (SMB enumeration)
- Dnsenum
- Fierce (DNS reconnaissance)

### Exploitation
- Metasploit Framework
- Hydra (Brute force)
- John the Ripper (Password cracking)
- Hashcat (Advanced password recovery)
- CrackMapExec (Active Directory)

---

## ü§ñ AI Integration (Exa.ai)

The tool uses Exa.ai for:
- Scan strategy optimization
- Vulnerability analysis recommendations
- Exploit technique suggestions
- Real-time threat intelligence

Configure your Exa.ai API key in the ExaInsights panel.

---

## üìä Logging & Debugging

### Backend Logs
All scan executions are logged with:
- Session IDs
- Timestamps
- Tool outputs
- Error details
- Exit codes

Logs appear in the console where you run `node index.js`

### Frontend Logs
Browser console shows:
- Backend connection status
- WebSocket state
- Tool execution progress
- Error messages with full stack traces

### Error Handling
When a tool fails, the system will show:
1. **What failed**: Tool name and target
2. **Why it failed**: Error message from the tool
3. **How to fix**: Suggested actions (e.g., check privileges, install tool)

---

## üîç Verification & Testing

### Test Backend Connection
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/check-kali
# Should return: {"isKali": true} if on Kali Linux
```

### Test Tool Availability
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tools/installed
# Returns list of all installed tools
```

### Run Test Scan
1. Open the application
2. Go to "Network Scanning"
3. Enter target: `scanme.nmap.org` (legal test target)
4. Start scan
5. Verify real-time output appears

---

## üö® Security Considerations

1. **Legal Compliance**
   - Only scan targets you own or have written permission to test
   - Unauthorized scanning is illegal in most jurisdictions
   - This tool is for professional security testing only

2. **Network Security**
   - Backend should be firewalled (only allow localhost access)
   - Use VPN/secure network for production deployments
   - Never expose backend directly to the internet

3. **Authentication** (Future Enhancement)
   - Consider adding authentication to the backend
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add API key validation

4. **Tool Privileges**
   - Some tools require root/sudo
   - Run backend with minimum required privileges
   - Use capability-based permissions where possible

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Backend Offline" Error
**Cause**: Cannot connect to Node.js backend
**Fix**:
```bash
cd server
sudo node index.js
```

### "Not Running on Kali Linux" Warning
**Cause**: Backend detected non-Kali system
**Fix**: This tool MUST run on Kali Linux. Deploy to Kali environment.

### Tool Not Found Errors
**Cause**: Required Kali tool not installed
**Fix**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <tool-name>
```

### Permission Denied Errors
**Cause**: Tool requires elevated privileges
**Fix**: Run backend with sudo:
```bash
sudo node index.js
```

### WebSocket Connection Failed
**Cause**: Firewall or network issue
**Fix**:
- Check if port 8080 is open
- Verify API_CONFIG.BASE_URL points to correct server
- Check browser console for detailed error

---

## üìà Performance Optimization

1. **Concurrent Scans**
   - Backend supports multiple simultaneous scans
   - Each scan gets a unique session ID
   - WebSocket per session for real-time streaming

2. **Timeouts**
   - Long-running scans have 10-15 minute timeouts
   - Configurable in backend (server/index.js)

3. **Resource Management**
   - Backend cleans up completed sessions
   - Tools are terminated on stop/abort
   - Memory-efficient streaming (no buffering)

---

1. **Automated Report Generation**
   - PDF/HTML reports with findings
   - Executive summaries
   - Remediation timelines

2. **Scheduled Scans**

   - Comparison with previous scans

3. **Multi-Target Scanning**

   - Asset discovery and tracking

4. **API Integration**
   - REST API for external integration
   - Webhook notifications
   - CI/CD pipeline integration

5. **Collaboration Features**

   - Role-based access control
   - Shared findings and notes

6. **Advanced Reporting**
   - CVSS scoring
